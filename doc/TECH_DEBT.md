# TODO technical debt list

*   Attach size limit per board
*   Memory overflow protection if multiple slow clients request same big file
*   Big upload protection (waiting for support in Cowboy)

## In progress

*   HTTP client tests for empty board, new thread, post reply, upload image,
    upload bad file, check all possible error conditions, etc.
